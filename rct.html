    What is a Root Canal?
</h1>
<section>
    <p>
        Root canal treatment is designed to eliminate bacteria from the infected root canal, prevent reinfection of the tooth and save the natural tooth. When one
        undergoes a root canal, the inflamed or infected pulp is removed and the
        inside of the tooth is carefully cleaned and disinfected, then filled and sealed.
